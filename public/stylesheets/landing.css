/*Imageanimation rule which feeds to slideshow above using images provided*/

/*From 0% to 10% (the beginning of our animation) the list item begins changing 
it's opacity from 0 to 1 (invisible to visible)*/

/*the animation-timing-function is set to ease-in at 0% and ease-out and 10%, 
makes for a more smooth fade-in*/

/*The list item's opacity then stays at 1 until it reaches 20% at which point 
it fades back out, reaching 0 at 30% and staying at 0 for the remainder of the animation*/

/*If we have 5 background images visible for 5 seconds each, then the time it 
takes to fade the image in and keep it visible is 10 seconds with a 5 second crossfade/fadeout 
into the next image; The entire animation cycle for all 5 images takes 50 seconds total*/

/*100% divided by 5 is 20% so each image's fadein and visibility should last 20% 
of the cycle; half of 20% is 10%, that is why our fade in is from 0% to 10%, then we keep it 
visible until 20% is reached and begin the fadeout from 20% to 30%, the 5 second fadeout overlaps 
the next image's 5 second fadein, which is what creates the crossfade effect*/
